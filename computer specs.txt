1) CPU

The DPC uses the Intel 8080 as it's central processing unit.

2) MEMORY

Because we are using the 8080 we can only address up to 64K at a time. To overcome this limitation 
the DPC uses memory banking. That means that by accessing certain I/O ports, a large chunk of memory
is swapped out for a different chunk to expand the amount of addressable memory. 

The first 48K of memory may be selected between any of four banks of memory. The upper 16K are used
in order to share memory between each bank, as well as provide a place for the OS to operate in each
bank. This expands the total useable memory to 208K. The bank can be changed by writing to port 10 (0xA).

FIRST MEMORY BANK:
 0x0000-0x03FF - BIOS
 0x0400-0x04FF - INPUT BUFFER
 0x0500-0x05FF - BIOS STACK
 0x0600-0X07FF - BIOS VARIABLES
 0x0800-0x57FF - VIDEO MEMORY
 0x5800-0x5A00 - OS LOADER
 0xC000-0xFFFF - SYSTEM SHARED MEMORY

The other three memory banks are handled by the OS. 

3) OS MEMORY HANDLING

SHARED MEMORY LAYOUT:
 0xC000-0xC3FF - OS system calls
 0xC400-0xC5FF - System stack
 0xC600-0xC7FF - Copy subroutine, semaphores and semaphore subroutines
 0xC800-0xFFFF - Copy space
